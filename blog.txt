Started this blog.  Going to be writing about the design and implementation of
dbustop (now aka chrometop).  Trevor has recommended that I write to keep track
of how ideas about the project change over time -- great idea!

After developing dbustop for approximately three weeks, I got to a point today
where I thought it would be good to get some direction on where to go next.  So
far, I have written two python executables: dbustop-server and dbustop-client.
On a high level, dbustop-server monitors the dbus and forwards dbus messages
over the network to clients.  dbustop-client connects to a dbustop-server
instance and gets dbus messages, doing what it wants with them.

dbustop-client provides an event-based foundation for passing dbus messages
from a network thread connected to a dbustop-server instance to a GUI thread.
