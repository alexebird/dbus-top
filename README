On a high level, dbustop-server monitors the dbus and forwards dbus messages
over the network to clients.  dbustop-client connects to a dbustop-server
instance and gets dbus messages, doing what it wants with them.

dbustop-client provides an event-based foundation for passing dbus messages
from a network thread connected to a dbustop-server instance to a GUI thread.
